# **App Name**: AyOS: The Hacker's Web OS

## Core Features:

- Terminal Emulator: Simulate a Linux terminal environment with common commands (cd, ls, rm, mkdir, echo, piping, command history).
- Code Editor: Provide a code editor for editing files within the simulated OS environment.
- Payload Studio: Develop an interface that allows users to construct and encode various payloads.
- Packet Viewer: Develop functionality to analyze captured network packets.
- AI Assistant (VoidMind CLI): Implement a terminal-integrated AI assistant. The AI will function as a tool answering ethical hacking and CTF-related questions via the terminal.
- Simulated Hacking Tools: Simulate password hash cracking using common wordlists.  Emulate /home, /etc, /opt, /bin, /usr directories.
- Persistent File System: Offer persistent storage for files and user data, using IndexedDB for browser-based storage.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Electric blue (#7DF9FF) for a vibrant, modern, cyber feel.
- Background color: Near-black (#080808) to emulate a dark terminal environment, providing contrast.
- Accent color: Neon green (#39FF14), for secondary highlights and interactive elements to capture the cyberpunk theme.
- Body and headline font: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for a computerized, techy feel; longer text is anticipated, so use 'Inter' (sans-serif) for body
- Code font: 'Source Code Pro' (monospace) for displaying code snippets and terminal output.
- Use simple line icons in neon colors to represent file types, tools, and actions.
- Implement a grid-based layout, commonly associated with terminal/hacker interfaces. Also emulate draggable and resizable windows to simulate a full OS.
